          Football is a sport where the players advance the ball down the field by running with the ball or passing it.
          The team with possession of the ball has their offense on the field, while the team that does not have possession of the ball has their defense on the field.
          Points are scored when the ball passes into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown, or kicking the ball through the goalposts for a field goal.
